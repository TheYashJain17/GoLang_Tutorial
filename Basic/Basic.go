/*The order we have provided below should remain same means first we have to declare the package which is main
in this case as it helps our function to run and then we have to import the "fmt" package to use it
and then at last we can defined the function to use it and remember to keep the function name main means
same as package name.*/

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	fmt.Println("GoodBye World") //use println instead of print command to get the better result.

	//fmt.Println is just like the console.log of javascript , just gets used to print something in the terminal.

}

/*For running this just simply go in the terminal and then go to the desired directory like in our case
it is basic directory so type :- cd basic then when you are inside that directory type:-
go run then filename with go extension which will gonna see like this :- go run basic.go and after 
thats it this will gonna run.*/
