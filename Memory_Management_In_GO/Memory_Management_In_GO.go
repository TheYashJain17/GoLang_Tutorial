// In this session we gonna see that how does memory management actually happens in go.

// This will gonna help us understand that what method should we use at a certain place.

/*In go language memory management(allocation and deallocation) happens automatically.
But lets understand little theory about regarding the same.*/

// There are 2 methods through which memory management happens:-

// 1. new()

// Lets first understand the new() method.

// In case of new method , memory is allocated but never initialised.

// We will get a memory address so that we can refer it and get the location.

// 2. make()

// In case of new method , we get zeroed storage means we cannot put any data initially.

// Now lets understand the make method.

// In case of make method , memory is allocated and also initialised.

// We will get a memory address so that we can refer it and get the location.

// In case of make method , we get non zeroed storage which means we can put any data initially.

// MOSTLY WE GONNA USE THE make METHOD.

// We will understand more about this through practical.

/*So this was all about this session , it is important as we gonna keep this in mind while working 
and using methods.*/

// Stay tuned for more updates.
